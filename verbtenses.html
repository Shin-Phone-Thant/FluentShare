    <h2><u>What are verb tenses?</u></h2>
    <br><br><br>
    <p>Verb tenses are grammatical forms that indicate when an action or state occurs in relation to the present, past, or future. They help convey the timing of an event, and they are essential for understanding when something happens, is happening, or will happen. In English, verb tenses can be classified into three main categories based on time: past, present, and future. Each of these categories can be broken down further into different aspects that show the state of the action (whether it's completed, ongoing, habitual, etc.).</p>
